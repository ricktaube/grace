<h1>The Console Window</h1>

<p>
The Console window acts as the main window for Grace: there is only one Console window and closing it will quit the application. The purpose of the Console is to serve as <var>standard output</var> for Lisp and to display any messages, errors or warnings that result from your work. 
</p>

<p>The appearance of the Console can be customized by changing its font size and selecting color themes for the window. A number of different themes are available under the <span class="menuitem">Console&gt;Themes</span> submenu. In general, a theme controls the Console's background color and the color of normal output text.  A few special types of messages have a consistent appearance across all themes: 

  
<ul style="font-size:larger;">
  <li><span class="graceerror">Error messages (red)</span></li>
  <li><span class="gracewarning">Warnings (orange)</span></li>  
  <li><span class="gracevalues">Return values (green)</span></li>  
</ul>
